# GraphQLM

GraphQLM is a novel framework designed to enable natural language querying of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) using Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository contains the code implementation of our proposed model. We have also developed a user interface for GraphQLM which is available @ https://graphqlm.streamlit.app/

Project Structure
The project consists of the following key files:

GraphRAG.py: This file contains the entire model framework. 

Database.py: This file is responsible for knowledge graph (KG) processing. 

GPTRetrieval.py: This file contains the prompts and interfaces to interact with the LLM.
